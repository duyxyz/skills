# Build Android APK

This workflow provides two ways to build your application for release: locally on your machine or automatically via GitHub Actions.

// turbo-all

## Option 1: Local Build
Build separate APKs for different Android architectures to keep file sizes small.

1. **Clean and Get Packages**
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Generate APKs**
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi
   ```
   *The outputs will be in `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/`.*

## Option 2: CI/CD Build (GitHub)
Trigger the automated build pipeline on GitHub to create a formal release with versioning.

1. **Commit your changes**
   Ensure all logic and features are committed to the main branch.

2. **Trigger Workflow**
   You can trigger the workflow from the GitHub "Actions" tab by selecting **"Flutter Build APK"** and clicking **"Run workflow"**.

3. **Verify Release**
   The workflow will automatically:
   - Build the APKs.
   - Create a new GitHub Release (e.g., `v1.0.X`).
   - Upload the APK files to the release.

## Troubleshooting
- **Keystore Error**: If build fails locally, ensure you have the `upload-keystore.jks` and `key.properties` configured in the `android/` folder.
- **Environment Secrets**: Ensure all GitHub Actions secrets (`KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `STORE_PASSWORD`) are set in your GitHub repository settings.
